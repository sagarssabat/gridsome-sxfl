                <p>
                  The Participant will be allotted an initial budget of 300

                <p>
                  The Participant has to make a Team of his choice using the

                  a) base value - The Base Value is the initial value per Unit
                  that is offered by the Platform and is available to
                  Participants for selection of their Team up till the Joining
                  Deadline.
                </p>
                <p>
                  b) The Match Value is the value per Unit and is calculated as
                  per the Player’s performance in the Match based on the Fantasy
                  Cricket Points System.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Match Value is usually updated while the Match is in
                  progress. The Match Value at the end of the match is also
                  referred as “Final Match Value”

                <p>
                  The end goal of every Participant is to maximise the final
                  value of his Team by choosing the right combination of 11
                  players who can be best relied upon to score points for your
                  team with their personal performances in batting, bowling
                  within the allocated credits apart from other considerations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Team Value is valued in terms of credits and is calculated
                  as the sum total of:
                </p>
                <p>a) Aggregate of Player values of each Player in the Team.</p>
                <p>b) Captain & Vice Captain Bonus</p>
                <p>c) Unused credits</p>
                <p>
                  For the purpose of calculating the Team Value, 1 point scored
                  in the Fantasy Cricket Points System is equal to 1 credit.<br />
                  1 point = 1 credit
                </p>
                <p>
                  Invested Team Value or “Invested Value” <br />
                  This is the Team Value based on the amounts of credits
                  invested by you until the Contest Deadline
                </p>
                <p>
                  Match Team Value or “Match Value” <br />
                  This is the Team Value based on the Match Values of the
                  players. The Match Team Value at the end of the match is also
                  referred as “Final Team Value”
                </p>

                <p>
                  a) Base Value - The Base Value is the initial value per Unit
                  that is offered by the Platform and is available to
                  Participants for selection of their Team Portfolio up till the
                  Joining Deadline.
                </p>
                <p>
                  b) Spot Value – This is the value per Unit during the Trading
                  Period and is by default the last traded value per Unit of
                  that Player.
                </p>
                <p>
                  c) The Match Value is the value per Unit and is calculated as
                  per the Player’s performance in the Match based on the Fantasy
                  Cricket Points System.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Match Value is usually updated while the Match is in
                  progress. The Match Value at the end of the match is also
                  referred as “Final Match Value”
                </p>

                <p>
                  The end goal of every Participant is to maximise the final
                  value of his Team Portfolio by choosing the right combination
                  of 11 players who can be best relied upon to score points for
                  your team with their personal performances in batting, bowling
                  and fielding and the right number of Units per Player within
                  the allocated credits apart from other considerations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Team Portfolio Value is valued in terms of credits and is
                  calculated as the sum total of:
                </p>
                <p>
                  a) Aggregate of Player values for every Unit of each Player in
                  the Team Portfolio
                </p>
                <p>b) Captain & Vice Captain Bonus</p>
                <p>c) Unused credits</p>
                <p>
                  For the purpose of calculating the Team Portfolio Value, 1
                  point scored in the Fantasy Cricket Points System is equal to
                  1 credit.<br />
                  <strong>1 point = 1 credit</strong>
