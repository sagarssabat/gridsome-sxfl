            Playing online fantasy cricket is a completely skill-based endeavour
            that depends largely on your understanding of the sport and your own
            instincts. The end goal is to create a match-winning Team / Team
            Portfolio using certain maximum number of players who can perform
            their best and to do that, one needs to consider several factors,
            some of which are given below:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Playing conditions</li>
            <li>Pitch and weather conditions</li>
            <li>Toss (depending on contest deadlines)</li>
            <li>Opposition</li>
            <li>Current form and track record</li>
            <li>Previous experience of playing against the same opposition</li>
            <li>Top batsmen and bowlers</li>
            <li>Uncapped Players</li>
            <li>Strengths and weaknesses</li>
            <li>Batting or Bowling order</li>
            <li>Fitness: Injured, Recovering or making a comeback</li>
            <li>Availability of chosen players</li>
            <li>Players who can score Bonus Points</li>
            <li>
              Playing fantasy cricket on SportzXchange also requires additional
              factors to be considered when compared to other fantasy cricket
              applications like
            </li>
            <li>
              Making a balanced portfolio within a specified budget allotted to
              you
            </li>
            <li>
              Variability in terms of number of units of a player within the
              team of 11 players (which players should I have with more units
              and which ones should be less)
            </li>
            <li>When and why should I trade?</li>
            <li>
              What is the right value to trade a player unit with another
              participant?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class="content-title">who can play?</h3>
          <ol>
