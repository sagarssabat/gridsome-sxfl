          <h3 class="content-title">Use of Cookies:</h3>
          <p>To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Platform for our Users, we use &quot;cookies&quot;, or
            such similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a
            User Identification (User ID) to understand the User&#39;s individual interests using the identified
            computer/device. Cookies are tiny text files which identify your computer/device to server as a unique
            user when you visit certain pages on the Platform and they are stored by your internet browser on your
            computer&#39;s/device’s hard drive/storage. Cookies can be used to recognize your Internet Protocol
            address, saving you time while you are on, or want to enter, the Platform and not for obtaining or using
            any other information about you. The acceptance of cookies is not a requirement for visiting/using the
            Platform. However, we would like to point out that some functionality on the Platform is only possible
            with the activation of cookies. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through
            registration), SportzXchange has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the
            User&#39;s computer/device. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by
            the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User&#39;s hard drive. SportzXchange’s advertisers may also
            assign their own cookies to the User&#39;s browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process
            that SportzXchange does not control.</p>
          <p> SportzXchange&#39;s web servers automatically collect limited information about User&#39;s
            computer&#39;s/device’s connection to the Internet, including User&#39;s IP address, when the User visits
            the Platform. (User&#39;s IP address is a number that lets computers/devices attached/connected to the
            Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User&#39;s
            IP address does not identify the User personally. SportzXchange uses this information to deliver its web
            pages to Users upon request, to tailor its Platform to the interests of its users, to measure traffic
            within the Platform and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where SportzXchange&#39;s
            visitors come. </p>
          <h3 class="content-title">Links:</h3>
          <p> SportzXchange also includes links to other websites/third-party applications. Such websites/applications
            are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond SportzXchange&#39;s control. Once the
            User leaves SportzXchange&#39;s servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the
            location bar on the User&#39;s browser), use of any information provided by the User is governed by the
            privacy policy of the operator of the site/application which the User is visiting. That policy may differ
            from SportzXchange&#39;s own. If the User can&#39;t find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a
            link from the site&#39;s homepage, the User may contact the site directly for more information.
            SportzXchange is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites/applications.
